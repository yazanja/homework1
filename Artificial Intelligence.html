 <u> <h1>ChatGPT</h1></u>
 <h2>What is ChatGPT ?</h2>
    <p><mark><b>ChatGPT</b></mark>is a <b><i>chatbot and virtual assistant</i></b> developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI">OpenAI</a>OpenAI and launched on <b>November 30, 2022</b>. <u>Based on large language models (LLMs)</u>, it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at each conversation stage as context. <sup>[2]</sup></p>
     <p>ChatGPT is credited with starting the AI boom, which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). <mark><sub>[3]</sub></mark>By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to the growth of OpenAI's current valuation of $86 billion. <sup>[4][5]</sup> ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[6] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In June 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced in which ChatGPT is integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems.[7] Some observers raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation. <sup>[8][9]</sup></p>

    <h2>How does ChatGPT work ?</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT works through its Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which uses specialized algorithms to find patterns within data sequences. ChatGPT originally used the GPT-3 large language model, a neural network machine learning model and the third generation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer. The transformer pulls from a significant amount of data to formulate a response.</p>
